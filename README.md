# Tree-network-structure-generation-for-heat-conduction-by-cellular-automaton

This repo contains the codes used in the following paper entitled:
[Tree-network structure generation for heat conduction by cellular automaton. R Boichot, L Luo, Y Fan - Energy Conversion and Management, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2008.09.003)

More exactly, this is a Matlab update of the original code made in Visula Basic 6. The code is easy to use. Enter the filling ratio and the ratio of conductivity os two materials on a heating surafec linked to a localized heat sink and it make the conductive matter in dark evolve following temperature gradients. The shape obtained is not stricto sensu optimal as there is no objective function in the code but present a very efficiend design to cool a distributed heated surface.
